# Hosting Alternatives Research for Garmin Webhooks

## Problem Statement

Vercel requires **$150/month** (on top of $20/month Pro plan) to bypass deployment protection for webhooks. This is too expensive for a personal/small project. We need hosting that allows public webhook endpoints without breaking the bank.

---

## Recommended Alternatives

### üèÜ **Top Pick: Cloudflare Workers**

**Why it's best for webhooks:**
- ‚úÖ **100,000 free requests/day** - More than enough for webhook traffic
- ‚úÖ **$5/month paid plan** if you exceed free tier
- ‚úÖ **No deployment protection issues** - Designed for public API endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Global edge network** - Fast response times worldwide
- ‚úÖ **No cold starts** - Workers are always warm

- **Paid tier**: $5/month (includes 10M requests/month)

**Perfect for:**
- Webhook endpoints (Garmin, Strava, etc.)
- API routes
- Serverless functions

**Limitations:**
- Different deployment model than Vercel (requires code adaptation)
- 10ms CPU time limit per request (plenty for webhooks)
- Learning curve if you're new to Workers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not Recommended: Render**

**Why it's not ideal for webhooks:**
- ‚ùå **No serverless functions** - Only long-running web services
- ‚ùå **Free tier spins down** after 15 minutes of inactivity
- ‚ùå **Cold starts** can take 30+ seconds
- ‚úÖ **$7/month** for always-on service

**Verdict:** Not suitable for webhooks due to spin-down and cold starts.

- Frontend ‚Üí Cloudflare Pages (free, unlimited)
- Database ‚Üí Keep Supabase (already external)

**Steps:**
1. Convert API routes to Workers format
2. Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages
3. Update Garmin webhook URL
4. Test thoroughly
5. Cancel Vercel

**Time estimate:** 4-8 hours

**Monthly cost:** $0 (likely stays within free tier)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

**What to do:**
- Keep frontend on Vercel free tier
- Move webhook endpoints to Cloudflare Workers
- Keep database on Supabase

**Steps:**
1. Extract webhook API routes to separate Workers
2. Deploy Workers to Cloudflare
3. Update Garmin webhook URL to Workers endpoint
4. Keep frontend on Vercel free tier

**Time estimate:** 2-4 hours

**Monthly cost:** $0

**Benefit:** No migration of frontend, only move problematic webhook endpoints

## Technical Considerations

### Cloudflare Workers Code Example

Converting a Vercel API route to Cloudflare Worker:

**Before (Vercel):**
```javascript
// api/garmin-webhook.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const data = req.body;
  // Process webhook
  res.status(200).json({ success: true });
}
```

**After (Cloudflare Worker):**
```javascript
// workers/garmin-webhook.js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const data = await request.json();
    // Process webhook (same logic)
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
  }
}
```

### Railway Deployment

Railway can deploy your existing Next.js app without code changes:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

## Conclusion

**The $150/month Vercel fee is NOT worth it for a personal project.**

My recommendation: Start with **Cloudflare Workers for webhooks only** (hybrid approach). This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Free webhooks
- ‚úÖ Keep Vercel for frontend
- ‚úÖ Minimal migration effort
- ‚úÖ Learn valuable Cloudflare Workers skills

If you want the absolute simplest path: **Railway for $5/month** and migrate everything in an afternoon.

Both options save you ~$165/month compared to Vercel's protection bypass add-on.
