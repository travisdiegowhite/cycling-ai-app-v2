## Power Zones & FTP

### Functional Threshold Power (FTP)

**Definition (2025 Update):** FTP is "the highest power a rider can maintain in a quasi-steady state without fatiguing" (Dr. Andrew Coggan).

**Note:** 2025 research shows that traditional 20-minute FTP tests may overestimate true threshold power by 5-10% for many athletes. Modern protocols now incorporate multiple test formats.

### Seven-Zone Power System (Coggan)

| Zone | Name | % FTP | Purpose | Duration | RPE |
|------|------|-------|---------|----------|-----|
| **1** | Active Recovery | <55% | Recovery, promotes blood flow | Hours | 0-3 |
| **2** | Endurance | 56-75% | Aerobic base, fat oxidation | Hours | 4-6 |
| **3** | Tempo | 76-90% | Aerobic power, muscular endurance | 60-180min | 5-7 |
| **3.5** | Sweet Spot | 88-94% | Time-efficient FTP building | 20-60min | 6-8 |
| **4** | Lactate Threshold | 91-105% | FTP development, race pace | 10-60min | 7-9 |
| **5** | VO2 Max | 106-120% | Aerobic capacity | 3-8min | 8-10 |
| **6** | Anaerobic Capacity | 121-150% | Short hard efforts | 30sec-3min | 10 |
| **7** | Neuromuscular Power | >150% | Max sprints | 5-30sec | 10+ |

### Physiological Adaptations by Zone

**Zone 1-2 (Endurance):**
- ↑ Mitochondrial density
- ↑ Capillarization
- ↑ Fat oxidation capacity
- ↑ Aerobic enzymes
- Should feel: Conversational, sustainable for hours

**Zone 3-3.5 (Tempo/Sweet Spot):**
- ↑ Glycogen storage capacity
- ↑ Muscular endurance
- Recruits Type IIa muscle fibers
- Should feel: Moderately hard, "all day" pace not quite sustainable

**Zone 4 (Threshold):**
- ↑ Lactate clearance
- ↑ Blood plasma volume
- ↑ Mitochondrial enzymes
- Should feel: Hard, sustainable 20-60 minutes

**Zone 5 (VO2 Max):**
- ↑ Cardiac stroke volume
- ↑ VO2max (maximum oxygen uptake)
- ↑ Blood plasma volume
- Should feel: Very hard, can only speak 1-2 words

**Zone 6-7 (Anaerobic/Neuromuscular):**
- ↑ Anaerobic capacity
- ↑ Neuromuscular power
- ↑ Phosphocreatine system
- Should feel: Maximal effort, unsustainable

## Training Methodologies

### 1. Polarized Training (80/20)

**Distribution:**
- 80% in Zone 1-2 (low intensity)
- <5% in Zone 3-4 (minimal)
- 15-20% in Zone 5+ (high intensity)

**Philosophy:**
The idea is to train at the "poles" of the intensity spectrum - either very easy or very hard, avoiding the "gray zone" (tempo/threshold).

**2025 Research Basis:**
- TrainingPeaks polarized methodology
- Norwegian research on elite endurance athletes
- Shown to maximize fitness gains while minimizing overtraining risk

**Sample Week (Polarized):**
```
Monday: Recovery Spin (30min Z1)
Tuesday: Foundation Miles (90min Z2)
Wednesday: 30/30 Intervals (60min with VO2 work)
Thursday: Easy Recovery (45min Z1)
Friday: Foundation Miles (60min Z2)
Saturday: Long Ride (4 hours Z2)
Sunday: Rest
```

**Weekly TSS:** ~400-500
**Best for:**
- Endurance events (gran fondos, centuries)
- Time-constrained athletes

Week 2: Traditional SST (45min total)
Week 3: 4x12min (48min total)
Week 4: Recovery week
Week 5-8: Repeat with slight power increase
```

---

### Threshold Intervals (Zone 4)

**Purpose:** Build FTP and lactate clearance

**Examples:**
- 2x20 at FTP (70min, 90 TSS) - The gold standard
- 3x12 Threshold (75min, 95 TSS)
- Over-Under Intervals (75min, 100 TSS)
- Threshold Pyramid (70min, 105 TSS)

**Key Points:**
- 95-105% FTP
- Hard but sustainable 10-60 minutes
- Limit to 2-3 sessions per week
- Requires 48-72 hours recovery

**Classic 2x20:**
- Most common threshold workout
- If you can't complete both intervals, FTP may be set too high
- Expect 5-10% power drop in second interval when fresh

**Over-Unders:**
- Alternates below (95%) and above (105%) FTP
- Teaches lactate clearance while at threshold
- Key workout for racing

---

### VO2 Max Intervals (Zone 5)

**Purpose:** Increase maximum aerobic capacity

**2025 Research-Backed Formats:**

**30/30 Intervals (60min, 85 TSS)**
- 30 seconds hard (130% FTP), 30 seconds easy
- 3 sets of 8 repetitions
- Maximizes time at VO2max
- Based on 2025 research

**40/20 Intervals (55min, 80 TSS)**
- 40 seconds on (125% FTP), 20 seconds off
- 3 sets of 6 repetitions
- Harder than 30/30 with less recovery

**5x4min VO2 Max (65min, 95 TSS)**
- Classic format: 5x4 minutes at 115% FTP
- 4-minute recoveries
- Sustainable for most athletes

**4x8min VO2 Max (75min, 105 TSS)**
- 2025 research shows 4x8 is optimal for VO2max gains

3. 5min recovery in group
4. 4x (1min surge at 120% + 4min settle at 85%)
5. 10min chase effort (100% FTP)

**Key Points:**
- Unstructured intensity
- Practices energy system transitions
- Mental training for racing
- Do 2-4 weeks before goal race

---

## Periodization

### Classic Periodization Model

**Phase 1: Base (6-12 weeks)**
- Focus: Aerobic foundation
- Volume: High (8-15 hours/week)
- Intensity: 80% Zone 1-2, 20% Zone 3
- Key Workouts: Long rides, tempo intervals
- Weekly TSS: 300-600

**Phase 2: Build (8-12 weeks)**
- Focus: FTP development
- Volume: Moderate-High (8-12 hours/week)
- Intensity: 60% Zone 1-2, 30% Zone 3-4, 10% Zone 5
- Key Workouts: Sweet Spot, threshold, VO2 intervals
- Weekly TSS: 400-650

**Phase 3: Peak (4-8 weeks)**
- Focus: Race-specific intensity
- Volume: Moderate (6-10 hours/week)
- Intensity: 50% Zone 1-2, 20% Zone 3-4, 30% Zone 5+
- Key Workouts: VO2max, race simulation, anaerobic work
- Weekly TSS: 350-550

**Phase 4: Taper (1-2 weeks)**
- Focus: Freshness for goal event
- Volume: Low (4-6 hours/week)
- Intensity: Maintain some high intensity, reduce volume 40-60%
- Weekly TSS: 150-250

**Recovery Weeks:**
- Every 3-4 weeks, reduce volume by 40-50%
- Maintain some intensity to preserve fitness
- Critical for adaptation and preventing overtraining

---

### Block Periodization (Alternative)

**Research Basis:** 1-8 week blocks of focused training

**Example 16-Week Plan:**
```
Weeks 1-4: Endurance Block (base)
Week 5: Recovery
Weeks 6-9: Sweet Spot Block (threshold)
Week 10: Recovery
Weeks 11-14: VO2 Max Block (intensity)
Week 15: Recovery
Week 16: Taper + Race
```

**Benefits:**
- Focused adaptation stimulus
- Clear training objectives
- Research shows similar gains to traditional periodization

---

## Training Load Management

### Training Stress Score (TSS)

**Formula:**
```
TSS = (duration_seconds ÷ 3600) × (NP ÷ FTP)² × 100
```

Where:
- NP = Normalized Power
- FTP = Functional Threshold Power

**TSS Interpretation:**
- <150: Low stress, easy recovery
- 150-300: Medium stress, some residual fatigue
- 300-450: High stress, 1-2 days recovery needed
- >450: Very high stress, several days recovery needed

---

### Chronic Training Load (CTL) - "Fitness"

**Calculation:** 42-day exponentially weighted average of daily TSS

**Interpretation:**
- <40: Low fitness
- 40-70: Moderate fitness
- 70-100: High fitness
- >100: Very high fitness (elite athletes)

**Rate of Change:**
- Safe: +5 CTL per week
- Aggressive: +8 CTL per week
- Risky: >10 CTL per week (overtraining risk)

---

### Acute Training Load (ATL) - "Fatigue"

**Calculation:** 7-day exponentially weighted average of daily TSS

**Interpretation:**
- Should track with CTL during training blocks
- Spikes during hard training weeks
- Drops during recovery weeks

---

### Training Stress Balance (TSB) - "Form"

**Formula:** `TSB = CTL - ATL`

**Interpretation:**
- **TSB > +25:** Very fresh, ready for racing
- **TSB +5 to +25:** Well rested, peak performance window
- **TSB -10 to +5:** Balanced, normal training state
- **TSB -30 to -10:** Fatigued, building fitness
- **TSB < -30:** Very fatigued, overtraining risk

**Race Preparation:**
- Target TSB of +5 to +15 on race day
- Taper to reduce ATL while maintaining CTL

---

## Evidence & Research

### Polarized Training

**Key Studies:**
- Stoggl & Sperlich (2014): Polarized training superior to threshold and high-volume training
- Seiler & Kjerland (2006): Elite endurance athletes naturally gravitate toward 80/20 distribution

**2025 Update:**
- TrainingPeaks 8-week polarized plan showed 8-12% FTP gains
- Norwegian 30/15 interval research (30sec hard, 15sec easy) showed superior 20-minute power gains

---

### Sweet Spot Training

**Research Basis:**
- Seiler (2010): 88-94% FTP provides high aerobic stimulus with manageable fatigue
- TrainerRoad data: Average 10-15% FTP gains over 12-week SST plans

**Mechanism:**
- Activates Type IIa fibers
- Near-maximal aerobic stimulus
- Lower glycogen depletion than threshold work
- Faster recovery than Zone 4 work

---

### VO2 Max Intervals

**Key Research:**
- Helgerud et al. (2007): 4x8 intervals most effective for VO2max improvement
- Tabata et al. (1996): 20/10 protocol (similar to 40/20) shown effective
- Rønnestad et al. (2020): 30/30 intervals maximize time at VO2max

**2025 Findings:**
- Longer intervals (4-8 minutes) build VO2max capacity
- Shorter intervals (30/30, 40/20) maximize time spent at VO2max
- Both approaches effective; use variety for different adaptations

---

### Threshold Training

**Classic Research:**
- Coggan & Allen: 2x20 at FTP as gold standard
- Laursen & Jenkins (2002): Over-under intervals improve lactate clearance

**Practical Application:**
- 2x20 most popular format but not necessarily optimal
- 3x12, 4x10, or continuous 40-60min all effective
- Over-unders specifically improve racing ability

---

## Conclusion

Power-based training provides objective, measurable, and repeatable training stimuli. By understanding power zones, training methodologies, and periodization principles, cyclists can train smarter and achieve better results.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Build a strong aerobic base** (Zone 1-2) - Foundation for all fitness
2. **Use Sweet Spot training** for time-efficient FTP gains
3. **Include VO2max work** during build/peak phases
4. **Manage training load** with CTL/ATL/TSB
5. **Follow periodization principles** - base, build, peak, taper
6. **Include recovery weeks** every 3-4 weeks
7. **Test and reassess FTP** every 6-8 weeks

**Most Important:** Consistency beats intensity. Progressive overload with adequate recovery produces the best long-term results.
