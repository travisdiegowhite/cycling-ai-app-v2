# Social Features Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed

### Phase 1: Database Foundation
- **Database Schema** ([social_features_schema.sql](../database/social_features_schema.sql))
  - `shared_routes` - Privacy-first route sharing with privacy zones
  - `route_comments` - Practical comments (conditions/tips/variants)
  - `route_collections` - Curated route lists
  - `connections` - Simple friend connections
  - `safety_checkins` - Optional location sharing for safety
  - `community_intel` - Anonymous aggregated data
  - `saved_routes` - User-saved routes
  - `user_profiles` - Minimal user profiles
  - Helper functions (verify_route_comment, accept_connection, etc.)

- **Row Level Security** ([social_features_rls.sql](../database/social_features_rls.sql))
  - Privacy-first RLS policies for all tables
  - Helper functions for access control
  - Proper permissions and grants

### Phase 2: Core Utilities
- **Route Sharing** ([src/utils/routeSharing.js](../src/utils/routeSharing.js))
  - Privacy zone detection (automatic home/work obscuring)
  - Route geometry sanitization
  - 5 sharing levels (private/link_only/friends/local/public)
  - Share token generation
  - Save/unsave routes
  - Get shared routes by token or user

- **Route Comments** ([src/utils/routeComments.js](../src/utils/routeComments.js))
  - Add/update/delete comments
  - 5 comment types (condition/tip/variant/hazard/amenity)
  - Verification system (upvoting useful info)
  - Time-based expiration for temporary conditions
  - Flag comments for moderation
  - Get friend comments for discovery

### Phase 3: UI Components
- **RouteDiscovery** ([src/components/RouteDiscovery.js](../src/components/RouteDiscovery.js))
  - 3-tab interface (Nearby/Friends/Curated)
  - Route cards with save functionality
  - Search and filtering
  - Collection browsing

- **RouteComments** ([src/components/RouteComments.js](../src/components/RouteComments.js))
  - Categorized comment display
  - Add comment modal with expiration
  - Verification (upvote) system
  - Flag/delete actions
  - Comment statistics

- **ShareRouteDialog** ([src/components/ShareRouteDialog.js](../src/components/ShareRouteDialog.js))
  - Privacy level selector
  - Start/end obscuring toggle
  - Link generation for link-only sharing
  - Expiration settings
  - Privacy warnings and info

## ðŸš§ Remaining Work

### Phase 4: Additional Features
1. **Community Intel & Heat Maps** (Pending)
   - Aggregate anonymous usage data
   - Popular times heat map
   - Local knowledge aggregation
   - Best conditions analysis

2. **Route Collections** (Pending)
   - Create/manage collections
   - Add routes to collections
   - Subscribe to collections
   - Collection discovery

3. **Friend Connection System** (Pending)
   - Send connection requests
   - Accept/reject requests
   - Manage permissions (can_see_routes, can_see_collections)
   - Friend list UI

4. **Safety Check-ins** (Pending)
   - Create check-in with route
   - Share location with emergency contacts
   - Auto-alert if overdue
   - Complete check-in

### Phase 5: Integration
1. **Integrate into existing components**
   - Add "Share" button to RouteBuilder
   - Add RouteComments to RouteStudio
   - Add RouteDiscovery to main navigation
   - Connect with Map component

2. **Navigation updates**
   - Add "Discover" page to AppLayout
   - Add "My Routes" page showing shared routes
   - Add "Friends" page for connections

3. **User profile setup**
   - Create UserProfile component
   - Allow setting display name, avatar
   - Privacy settings
   - Location for local discovery

### Phase 6: Database Migration
1. **Run migrations** (Important!)
   ```bash
   # Connect to Supabase and run:
   psql $DATABASE_URL < database/social_features_schema.sql
   psql $DATABASE_URL < database/social_features_rls.sql
   ```

2. **Create user profiles for existing users**
   - Backfill user_profiles table
   - Set default privacy settings

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before testing)
1. Run database migrations on Supabase
2. Test route sharing flow end-to-end
3. Test comment system
4. Fix any import/export issues

### Short-term
1. Build friend connection system
2. Add social features to navigation
3. Integrate ShareRouteDialog into RouteBuilder
4. Add RouteComments to route detail views

### Medium-term
1. Build community intel aggregation
2. Implement route collections
3. Add safety check-in feature
4. Create user profile page

### Long-term
1. Mobile responsiveness for all social components
2. Notifications for friend requests, comment replies
3. Route recommendations based on saved routes
4. Community moderation tools

## Key Design Principles Maintained

âœ… **Privacy-first**: Everything defaults to private, explicit opt-in for sharing
âœ… **Routes over activities**: Focus on sharing routes, not ride tracking
âœ… **Utility over vanity**: Comments provide practical info, not kudos
âœ… **No performance pressure**: No leaderboards, KOMs, or activity feeds
âœ… **Anonymous aggregation**: Learn from community without exposure
âœ… **Minimal social obligations**: No likes, no follower counts

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create and share a route (all 5 levels)
- [ ] Test privacy zone detection and obscuring
- [ ] Add comments of each type
- [ ] Verify comments (upvote)
- [ ] Save someone else's shared route
- [ ] Access route via share token
- [ ] Test expiration (date-based)
- [ ] Test RLS policies (can't access others' private routes)
- [ ] Test comment moderation (flag)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## Known Issues / TODOs

1. Need to add missing import in RouteComments.js (supabase import)
2. Need to handle route geometry formats (GeoJSON vs array)
3. Need to test with real user profiles and avatars
4. Need to add loading states for all async operations
5. Need error boundaries for components
6. Need to handle offline/network errors gracefully

## Documentation Needed

1. User guide for sharing routes
2. Privacy policy updates
3. Community guidelines for comments
4. API documentation for developers
5. Database schema documentation
