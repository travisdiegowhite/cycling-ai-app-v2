## Technical Details

### State Management

**AIRouteGenerator.js:**
```javascript
const [selectedLibraryWorkout, setSelectedLibraryWorkout] = useState(null);

const handleLibraryWorkoutSelect = useCallback((workout) => {
  setSelectedLibraryWorkout(workout);

  // Update training context
  setTrainingContext({
    workoutType: workout.category,
    phase: 'build',
    targetDuration: workout.duration,
    targetTSS: workout.targetTSS,
    primaryZone: workout.primaryZone || 2
  });

  // Update time slider
  setTimeAvailable(workout.duration);

  // Mark as manually set
  setTrainingContextManuallySet(true);

  // Clear training plan selection
  setSelectedWorkout(null);

  toast.success(`Workout selected: ${workout.name}`);
}, []);
```

### Workout Data Structure

```javascript
{
  id: 'traditional_sst',
  name: 'Traditional Sweet Spot',
  category: 'sweet_spot',
  difficulty: 'intermediate',
  duration: 65,
  targetTSS: 85,
  intensityFactor: 0.90,
  description: 'Classic 45-minute sweet spot workout...',
  focusArea: 'threshold',
  tags: ['sst', 'sweet-spot', 'threshold-building'],
  terrainType: 'flat',
  structure: {
    warmup: { duration: 10, zone: 2, powerPctFTP: 65 },
    main: [...],
    cooldown: { duration: 10, zone: 1, powerPctFTP: 50 }
  },
  coachNotes: 'Most time-efficient training zone...',
  primaryZone: 3.5
}
```

## Database Migration (Optional)

To add workouts to the database for future persistence:

```bash
cd /home/travis/Desktop/cycling-ai-app-v2
node scripts/apply-workout-migration.js
```

This adds all 25+ workouts to the `workout_templates` table in Supabase.

**Note:** The workout library currently works entirely from the JavaScript file (`workoutLibrary.js`), so the database migration is optional for now. It's useful if you want to:
- Allow users to create custom workouts
- Track which workouts are most popular
- Add user ratings/reviews to workouts
