## How This Attracts Strava Users

### 1. **Fills Strava's Gaps**

**Strava Has:**
- Activity tracking and social features
- Basic route builder
- Segment leaderboards

**Strava DOESN'T Have:**
- Structured training plans ❌
- Power-based workouts ❌
- Workout library ❌
- Training load management (CTL/ATL) - **paywalled** ($80/year)

**You Now Have:**
- ✅ 40+ research-backed workouts
- ✅ 5 complete training plans
- ✅ 4 training methodologies
- ✅ Full CTL/ATL/TSB tracking (you already have this!)
- ✅ Integration with routes (you have this!)

### 2. **Better Than Strava Summit**

**Strava Summit ($80/year) provides:**
- Training analysis (CTL/ATL)
- Route building
- Segment leaderboards

**tribos.studio provides:**
- Everything Strava has, PLUS:
- AI-powered route generation
- Structured training plans
- Workout library
- Training plan templates
- Zone-colored route visualization
- Interval cues on routes

**Positioning:** *"The training platform Strava should have built"*

---

## How This Compares to TrainerRoad

### TrainerRoad ($20/month = $240/year)

**What they have:**
- Indoor trainer workouts ✅
- Training plans ✅
- FTP testing protocols ✅

**What they DON'T have:**
- Route generation ❌
- Outdoor ride planning ❌
- Real-world route integration ❌
- Community route sharing ❌

### tribos.studio Advantage

**You have BOTH:**
1. **Structured training** (like TrainerRoad)
2. **Real-world route integration** (unique to you!)

**Example User Flow:**
1. User selects "3x10 Sweet Spot" from workout library
2. AI generates route that matches: 60min duration, 80 TSS, flat terrain
3. Route displays zone-colored intervals
4. User rides with turn-by-turn + interval cues
5. Completed ride syncs to Strava
6. Training metrics (CTL/ATL/TSB) update automatically

**This is UNIQUE.** No one else does this.

## Next Steps: Integration

### 1. **Workout Selector Component**

Add to Route Generator and Route Studio:

```jsx
import { WORKOUT_LIBRARY } from '../data/workoutLibrary';

<Select
  label="Choose a workout"
  data={Object.values(WORKOUT_LIBRARY).map(w => ({
    value: w.id,
    label: `${w.name} (${w.duration}min, ${w.targetTSS} TSS)`,
    group: w.category
  }))}
  onChange={(workoutId) => {
    const workout = WORKOUT_LIBRARY[workoutId];
    // Auto-set route parameters from workout
    setTargetDuration(workout.duration);
    setTargetTSS(workout.targetTSS);
    setTerrainType(workout.terrainType);
  }}
/>
```

### 2. **Training Plan Wizard**

Enhance [TrainingPlanBuilder.js](../src/components/TrainingPlanBuilder.js):

```jsx
import { TRAINING_PLAN_TEMPLATES } from '../data/trainingPlanTemplates';

// Step 1: Choose template or custom
<Radio.Group label="Start with a template or build custom?">
  <Radio value="polarized_8_week" label="8-Week Polarized FTP Builder" />
  <Radio value="sweet_spot_12_week" label="12-Week Sweet Spot Base" />
  <Radio value="century_16_week" label="16-Week Century Preparation" />
  <Radio value="custom" label="Build custom plan" />
</Radio.Group>

// Load template and populate weekly schedule
if (selectedTemplate) {
  const template = TRAINING_PLAN_TEMPLATES[selectedTemplate];
  setWeeklySchedule(generateScheduleFromTemplate(template));
}
```

### 3. **Workout Detail View**

Show workout structure before generating route:

```jsx
function WorkoutDetail({ workoutId }) {
  const workout = WORKOUT_LIBRARY[workoutId];

  return (
    <Card>
      <Title>{workout.name}</Title>
      <Badge>{workout.duration}min</Badge>
      <Badge>{workout.targetTSS} TSS</Badge>
      <Badge color={ZONE_COLORS[workout.primaryZone]}>
        {TRAINING_ZONES[workout.primaryZone].name}
      </Badge>

      <Text>{workout.description}</Text>

      <WorkoutStructureViz structure={workout.structure} />

      <Alert icon={<Lightbulb />}>
        <strong>Coach Notes:</strong> {workout.coachNotes}
      </Alert>

      <Button onClick={() => generateRouteForWorkout(workout)}>
        Generate Route for This Workout
      </Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### 4. **Apply Database Migration**

```bash
cd /home/travis/Desktop/cycling-ai-app-v2
node scripts/apply-workout-migration.js
```

This will add all 25+ workouts to your `workout_templates` table.

### 5. **Marketing Content**

Create pages:
- `/training-science` - Embeds TRAINING_SCIENCE_2025.md
- `/workout-library` - Browse all 40+ workouts
- `/training-plans` - Browse pre-built plans
- `/strava-alternative` - Comparison page
